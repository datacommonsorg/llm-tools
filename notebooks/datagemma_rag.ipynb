This notebook connects to DataGemma, the first [open model](https://huggingface.co/google/datagemma-rag-27b-it) designed to connect large language models with the extensive, real-world data housed within Google's [Data Commons](https://datacommons.org).\n",

[Table 5] provides data on COPD rates for each state from 2014 to 2021. \n> \n> Let's focus on the top 10 states with the highest coal-fired power generation in 2020 [Table 4]:\n> \n> 1. **Wyoming:** 57220.4734 kWh\n> 2. **West Virginia:** 28115.9007 kWh\n> 3. **North Dakota:** 32042.801 kWh\n> 4. **Kentucky:** 9746.6756 kWh\n> 5. **Nebraska:** 9734.179 kWh\n> 6. **Missouri:** 8413.2103 kWh\n> 7. **Montana:** 7903.9661 kWh\n> 8. **Utah:** 7017.4985 kWh\n> 9. **Indiana:** 7072.5945 kWh\n> 10. **Arkansas:** 5088.5615 kWh\n> \n> Now let's see their corresponding COPD rates in 2020 [Table 5]:\n> \n> 1. **Wyoming:** 6.0342% \n> 2. **West Virginia:** 9.9151% \n> 3. **North Dakota:** 5.4658%\n> 4. **Kentucky:** 8.9724% \n> 5. **Nebraska:** 5.0078%\n> 6. **Missouri:** 7.1813% \n> 7. **Montana:** 5.9228% \n> 8. **Utah:** 4.7961% \n> 9. **Indiana:** 7.4786% \n> 10. **Arkansas:** 7.7975%\n> \n> **Observations:**\n> \n> * States like West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, and Arkansas have both high coal-fired power generation and high COPD rates.\n> * However, states like Wyoming, North Dakota, Nebraska, and Utah have high coal-fired power generation but relatively lower COPD rates. \n> \n> **Conclusion:**\n> \n> While some states with high coal-fired power generation also exhibit high COPD rates, there isn't a simple direct correlation. Other factors likely contribute to COPD prevalence, including smoking rates, air pollution from other sources, and access to healthcare. \n> \n> \n> #### TABLES ####\n> Table 1: Net Generation, Coal,

        "# More Information on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
        "\n",
        "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): This established approach retrieves relevant information from Data Commons before the LLM generates text, providing it with a factual foundation for its response. This implementation is only possible because of Gemini 1.5 Pro’s long context window allowing us to append the user query with the Data Commons data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how RAG works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   User Query: A user submits a query to the LLM.\n",
        "2.   Query Analysis & Data Commons Query Generation: The DataGemma model (based on the Gemma 2 (27B) model and fully fine-tuned for this RAG task) analyzes the user's query and generates a corresponding query (or queries) in natural language that can be understood by Data Commons' existing natural language interface.\n",
        "3.   Data Retrieval from Data Commons: Data Commons is queried using this natural language query, and relevant data tables, source information, and links are retrieved.\n",
        "4.   Augmented Prompt: The retrieved information is added to the original user query, creating an augmented prompt.\n",
        "5.   Final Response Generation: A larger LLM (Gemini 1.5 Pro) uses this augmented prompt, including the retrieved data, to generate a comprehensive and grounded response.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the above example, 7 questions are asked of Data Commons (eg \"What is the rate of coal fired power in US states?\") and corresponding data tables are retrieved. The data in these table is used to compose the final response with coherent information and insight."
