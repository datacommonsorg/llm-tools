This implementation is only possible because of Gemini 1.5 Proâ€™s long context window allowing us to append the user query with the Data Commons data.\n",

Query Analysis & Data Commons Query Generation: The DataGemma model (based on the Gemma 2 (27B) model and fully fine-tuned for this RAG task) analyzes the user's query and generates a corresponding query (or queries) in natural language that can be understood by Data Commons' existing natural language interface.\n",
        "3.   Data Retrieval from Data Commons: Data Commons is queried using this natural language query, and relevant data tables, source information, and links are retrieved.\n",
        "4.   Augmented Prompt: The retrieved information is added to the original user query, creating an augmented prompt.\n",
        "5.   Final Response Generation: A larger LLM (Gemini 1.5 Pro) uses this augmented prompt, including the retrieved data, to generate a comprehensive and grounded response.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the above example, 14 questions are asked of Data Commons (eg \"What is the population of Sunnyvale?\") and corresponding data tables are retrieved. The data in these table is used to compose the final response with coherent information and insight."
